# odin-recursion

This repository is part of Project: Recursion, a JavaScript course offered by The Odin Project. In this project, we delve into two classic problems that leverage recursion: Fibonacci and Merge Sort.

Fibonacci
The Fibonacci Sequence is a numerical series where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 are the first eight digits in the sequence. Although it can be solved iteratively, generating the sequence recursively provides valuable insights into recursion.

Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that utilizes recursion and the "divide and conquer" approach. It recursively divides an array into smaller sub-arrays, sorts them, and merges them back together in sorted order.
